    <!-- Riding The Wave Tool -->
    <string name="rtw_title">Riding the Wave</string>
    <string name="rtw_intro">You\'re having a panic attack right now and thinking \"Why should I trust this?\". Here\'s why you can trust it: every panic attack you\'ve ever had - even the ones where you were 100% sure you were dying - ended all by itself.\n\nThat\'s because panic is a surge of adrenaline, and your body simply cannot keep pumping it out forever. It always runs out of fuel and the attack stops, usually within 4-10 minutes at most.\n\n\"Riding the wave\" is one of the main skills taught in Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), a treatment used in hospitals and clinics all over the world for intense panic and emotions. People who learn to stop fighting the feelings finish their panic attacks much faster - often in half the time or less - and have fewer attacks overall.\n\nFighting the wave (\"Make it stop!\") keeps it going for 20-40 minutes. Letting it rise and fall turns it into a 3-5 minute rough patch instead. This isn\'t wishful thinking; it\'s how your body actually works, and thousands of people just like you have proved it.\n\nYou\'re about to prove it too.</string>
    
    <string name="rtw_step_1">Your heart is pounding. Your chest feels tight. You feel dizzy or unreal. That\'s okay. This is just a wave of adrenaline - it feels awful, but it CANNOT hurt you and it ALWAYS ends. Every single panic attack you\'ve ever had has stopped on its own. This one will too - faster if you stop fighting it.</string>
    <string name="rtw_step_2">Right now, put your phone down for a second and say inside your head:\n\n\"Okay, here it comes. It\'s just the wave.\"</string>
    <string name="rtw_step_3">Don\'t try to slow your breathing. Don\'t try to calm down. Don\'t fight any feeling. Let your heart race as fast as it wants. Let your hands shake. Let the dizziness be there. You are allowing everything to happen exactly as it is.</string>
    <string name="rtw_step_4">Silently tell your body:\n\n\"Go ahead - do your worst. I\'m not going to stop you.\"</string>
    <string name="rtw_step_5">Notice where you feel it most - chest, stomach, throat? Just watch it like you\'re watching a wave at the beach. You don\'t have to like it, you only have to let it be there.</string>
    <string name="rtw_step_6">Keep watching. In a moment you\'ll feel the first tiny drop - maybe your shoulders loosen a bit or the tightness eases just a little. That\'s the wave starting to crash.</string>
    <string name="rtw_step_7">Stay with it. The peak is passing right now. It\'s already going down, even if it doesn\'t feel calm yet.</string>
    <string name="rtw_step_8">You\'re doing it. You\'re riding it instead of drowning in it. A few more breaths and it will keep falling.</string>
    <string name="rtw_step_9">There... feel that? It\'s getting smaller. You\'re safe. The wave is leaving all by itself - because you let it.</string>
    <string name="rtw_step_10">You did it. It\'s over much sooner than if you had fought.\n\nNext time it will be even shorter. You\'ve just proved you can ride any wave.</string>

    <!-- Postpone The Worry Tool -->
    <string name="ptw_title">Postpone the Worry</string>
    <string name="ptw_intro">You\'re thinking: \"Just delay it? That can\'t possibly work.\" It feels too simple, but it\'s one of the most powerful tools in Metacognitive Therapy, the treatment that has been shown in research to reduce anxiety faster and more lastingly than traditional methods.\n\nYour brain treats every scary thought as an urgent problem that must be solved immediately. In a plane, that\'s useless: there is nothing you can do about the wings or the engines right now. Keeping the worry running for hours only exhausts you.\n\nThe trick is to give the worry an official, specific time later - so your mind accepts that the job is safely scheduled and stops pressing the alarm button.</string>
    
    <string name="ptw_step_1">Do this right now:\n\nSay to yourself (quietly or in your head):\n\n\"All worrying and what-if thoughts about the flight are now officially postponed until the very last minute of this flight, just before we land.\"</string>
    <string name="ptw_step_2">Whenever another scary thought appears, answer it with the exact same sentence:\n\n\"Thank you. Postponed until the final minute.\"</string>
    <string name="ptw_step_3">That\'s all. No fighting, no arguing, no reassuring yourself the plane is safe. Just postpone.</string>
    <string name="ptw_step_4">Most people notice the pressure drop within 30-60 seconds because the brain no longer believes the worry is needed right now.</string>
    <string name="ptw_step_5">And here\'s what almost always happens: when that final minute actually arrives hours later, you\'ll look up and realise the worry feels tiny - or you won\'t even remember what you were going to worry about.</string>
    <string name="ptw_step_6">Either way, you will have given yourself hours of calm instead of hours of torment.\n\nPostpone it. You haven\'t lost anything, and you\'ve just reclaimed the rest of your flight.</string>

    <!-- Worry Olympics Tool -->
    <string name="wo_title">Worry Olympics</string>
    <string name="wo_intro">Therapists use this exact method because when you try - with total commitment - to scare yourself even worse on purpose, your brain almost always goes \"Wait... this is ridiculous\" and the panic collapses into laughter or relief in seconds.\n\nDo it right now. Follow every step exactly:</string>
    
    <string name="wo_step_1">Step 1: What You\'re Actually Thinking Right Now\n\nClose your eyes. Don\'t fight it-lean into it. Mentally catalogue the \"evidence\" your anxiety is presenting:\n\n\"That rattle is new. We just dropped 200 feet, I felt it. The wing is bending way too much. Pilot hasn\'t spoken in 8 minutes-he\'s either dead or too busy fighting the controls to talk. Flight attendant smiled too wide; that\'s reassurance masking panic. I should have driven.\"</string>
    <string name="wo_step_2">Step 2: Give Your Fear the Microphone\n\nImagine standing up, grabbing the intercom, and delivering-dead serious-what your nervous system is screaming:\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, passenger in 22B. I have updates. That vibration is not normal turbulence; it\'s a harmonic imbalance in the port engine. The wing is flexing beyond manufacturer specs-I\'ve been watching it. The pilot\'s silence is now at 11 minutes, which in aviation time is roughly forever. Also, the coffee tasted off, which is probably hydraulic fluid contamination. I have no formal flight training, but I\'ve consumed every air crash investigation documentary ever made, and I am qualified to say: we should be panicking. Please panic in an orderly fashion.\"</string>
    <string name="wo_step_3">Step 3: What Passengers Are Actually Thinking\n\nLook around.\n\nThe guy next to you: \"Did I close the garage door?\"\n\nThe woman across the aisle: \"Why is the Wi-Fi $8 for 30 minutes? This is theft.\"\n\nKid behind you: \"My iPad is at 3% and this plane has no outlets. My life is over.\"\n\nFlight attendant: \"If one more person asks me about the chicken or pasta option, I\'m quitting.\"</string>
    <string name="wo_step_4">Step 4: Abruptly Yell \"CUT!\"\n\nOpen your eyes. Same engine hum. Same wing flex. Same plane. The only thing that crashed was the story you were telling yourself-because once you voiced it aloud (even just mentally), your brain heard how absurd it sounds.</string>
    <string name="wo_step_5">What Just Happened?\n\nYou caught the fear red-handed, scripting the disaster. You were the narrator, not the passenger. And narrators can change the channel.</string>

    <!-- Facing The Fear Tool -->
    <string name="ftf_title">Facing the Fear</string>
    <string name="ftf_intro">For right now, when the panic feels huge and solid.\n\nSit back, keep your eyes open or closed-whatever feels okay.\n\nWe\'re going to fly straight into the middle of this scary feeling, like a pilot flying into a dark cloud that looks terrifying from far away. Everyone knows that when the plane actually enters the cloud, there\'s nothing there-just soft mist. Let\'s do the same with this emotion.</string>
    
    <string name="ftf_step_1">Start by noticing the feeling as a whole. From a little distance it looks black, heavy, dangerous. That\'s normal. Now we\'re going to get closer, the way a scientist would, curious instead of scared.\n\nFind the strongest part of the feeling right now. Where is it exactly?\n\nMaybe a tight band around your chest, or pressure in your throat, or a swirling in your stomach. Put your attention gently on that spot. Don\'t push it away-just look.</string>
    <string name="ftf_step_2">Ask the feeling, quietly: \"Where are your edges?\"\n\nClouds always look solid from afar, but up close they have no hard border. Is this feeling sharp and solid, or is it actually fuzzy, changing, moving the moment you try to grab it?</string>
    <string name="ftf_step_3">Notice your heart beating fast.\n\nWhen you run for the bus or go up the stairs quickly, your heart races even harder than this-and you don\'t mind at all. What\'s the difference right now?\n\nOnly the story that says \"fast heart = danger.\" Without that story, it\'s just a heart doing its job.</string>
    <string name="ftf_step_4">Now zoom in even closer, like putting the feeling under a microscope.\n\nIs the tightness in your chest actually painful, or is it just pressure?\n\nIs the dizziness really the world spinning, or is it a light, floaty sensation with a scary label stuck on it?</string>
    <string name="ftf_step_5">Keep breathing normally and ask: \"If I didn\'t call this feeling \'panic,\' what would it be?\"\n\nA warm wave? Energy moving? A tingling?\n\nMost people discover it\'s just ordinary body sensations wearing a monster mask.</string>
    <string name="ftf_step_6">Look for the scariest part again. Where did it go?\n\nThe closer you get, the more it dissolves. Just like a real cloud-there\'s no dark centre, no monster hiding inside. Only soft, passing mist.</string>
    <string name="ftf_step_7">Stay here for a few more breaths.\n\nNothing to fix, nothing to fight. You\'re flying right through the middle of the cloud and discovering there was never anything solid to crash into.</string>
    <string name="ftf_step_8">When you\'re ready, open your eyes or soften your gaze.\n\nThe feeling may still be around, but you\'ve seen the truth: it\'s made of the same harmless stuff as every other sensation-just clouds passing through an open sky.\n\nYou can always fly into any cloud and find the same thing: nothing there.</string>

    <!-- Takeoff Questions -->
    <string name="takeoff_q1">What if the engines fail on takeoff?</string>
    <string name="takeoff_a1">Aircraft are certified to climb safely even if one engine fails at the most critical moment (V1). Pilots train for this scenario constantly. If an engine fails before V1, they stop safely on the runway. If it fails after V1, they continue the takeoff and circle back to land.</string>

    <string name="takeoff_q2">Why does the engine noise change/decrease shortly after takeoff?</string>
    <string name="takeoff_a2">This is normal! Pilots use maximum power for the initial lift-off. Once at a safe altitude (usually 1000-1500ft), they reduce power to "climb thrust" to save fuel and reduce noise for people on the ground. It feels like "falling" but you are still climbing, just accelerating less aggressively.</string>

    <string name="takeoff_q3">Why do the wings flex so much?</string>
    <string name="takeoff_a3">Wings are designed to be flexible! If they were rigid, they would snap. Modern wings can bend upwards by several meters (over 15 feet!) during stress tests without breaking. Watching them bounce is proof they are absorbing the turbulence for you.</string>

    <string name="takeoff_q4">What is that "ding" sound right after takeoff?</string>
    <string name="takeoff_a4">That "ding" (usually around 10,000 feet) is a signal to the flight attendants that it is safe to stand up and start service. It also often signals the end of the "sterile cockpit" rule, meaning pilots can now discuss non-essential topics.</string>

    <string name="takeoff_q5">Why does the plane sometimes sink or drop right after lifting off?</string>
    <string name="takeoff_a5">It is an illusion! Your inner ear (vestibular system) detects acceleration. When the plane reduces its rate of acceleration (during thrust reduction or flap retraction), your body interprets this "slowing down of speeding up" as "falling backwards." The altimeter proves you are still climbing.</string>

    <string name="takeoff_q6">What happens if we hit a bird?</string>
    <string name="takeoff_a6">Bird strikes are common and rarely dangerous. Engines are tested to ingest birds and keep running or shut down safely without exploding. If a strike happens, pilots will simply circle back and land. The "Sully" Miracle on the Hudson was an extremely rare case of hitting an entire flock of large geese in both engines simultaneously.</string>

    <string name="takeoff_q7">Why do the lights flicker or go out before takeoff?</string>
    <string name="takeoff_a7">The aircraft is switching from ground power (APU or airport cable) to the main engine generators. The momentary flicker is just the electrical system transferring the load. It is exactly like your lights blinking at home during a storm.</string>

    <string name="takeoff_q8">What are those loud "thuds" and "whirring" sounds from below?</string>
    <string name="takeoff_a8">The "thud" is the landing gear retracting into the fuselage and the gear doors closing. The "whirring" or hydraulic noise is the pump moving the heavy gear and flaps. These are the sounds of the airplane cleaning itself up for efficient flight.</string>

    <!-- Flight Items -->
    <string name="flight_q1">Can turbulence flip the plane over?</string>
    <string name="flight_a1">Absolutely not. Commercial jets are inherently stable. If the pilots let go of the controls during turbulence, the plane would naturally want to return to level flight, like a heavy pendulum. Turbulence is uncomfortable, but never dangerous to the airframe.</string>

    <string name="flight_q2">What happens if we get struck by lightning?</string>
    <string name="flight_a2">Planes get hit by lightning almost daily! The aluminum or composite skin acts as a "Faraday Cage," directing the electricity around the outside of the plane and back into the air. You might see a flash and hear a bang, but the electronics and systems are shielded.</string>

    <string name="flight_q3">Why is the seatbelt sign on when it feels smooth?</string>
    <string name="flight_a3">Pilots have weather radar and reports from other planes. They can "see" turbulence ahead that you cannot feel yet. They turn the sign on proactively to keep you safe before the bumps start. It is not a sign of impending doom, just caution.</string>

    <string name="flight_q4">Can the door be opened during flight?</string>
    <string name="flight_a4">Physically impossible. Airplane doors are "plug doors," meaning they are larger than the frame and open inwards. The cabin pressure pushes the door against the frame with thousands of pounds of force. No human is strong enough to overcome that pressure.</string>

    <string name="flight_q5">What if the autopilot fails?</string>
    <string name="flight_a5">Pilots fly manually during takeoff and landing often just for practice! If the autopilot disconnects, an alarm sounds, and the pilots simply grab the yoke and fly the plane. It is a non-event. They are pilots first, computer managers second.</string>

    <string name="flight_q6">Why are we circling?</string>
    <string name="flight_a6">Holding patterns are standard traffic management. Maybe the airport is busy, the weather is clearing up, or a runway is being inspected. It means the system is working to keep safe spacing between planes. You have plenty of reserve fuel for this.</string>

    <string name="flight_q7">What is "Clear Air Turbulence"?</string>
    <string name="flight_a7">Usually pilots avoid turbulence by seeing clouds on radar. "Clear Air Turbulence" (CAT) happens in cloudless sky, often near jet streams. It is invisible to radar, which is why it surprises pilots. It is annoying, but still not dangerous to the structure of the plane.</string>

    <string name="flight_q8">Are the pilots sleeping?</string>
    <string name="flight_a8">On very long flights (over 8-10 hours), there are relief pilots on board so the crew can take turns sleeping in dedicated bunks. On shorter flights, "Controlled Rest" is sometimes allowed—one pilot naps for 20-40 mins while the other monitors, but strictly following rules.</string>

    <string name="flight_q9">What is that "barking dog" sound on Airbus planes?</string>
    <string name="flight_a9">That is the PTU (Power Transfer Unit). It balances hydraulic pressure between the different systems (Green, Yellow, Blue). When one system is turned off or changes pressure (like during taxiing), the PTU kicks in to equalize them. It makes a distinctive "woof-woof" or sawing sound.</string>

    <!-- Landing Items -->
    <string name="landing_q1">How Pilots Decide If It’s Safe to Land</string>
    <string name="landing_a1">Imagine you’re sitting at your window seat on final approach. The runway lights are in sight, the seat-belt sign has been on forever, and suddenly… the engines roar, the nose pitches up, and you’re climbing again. Your heart jumps. “Something went wrong!” you think.\n\nActually, the opposite happened: everything just went exactly right.\n\nHere’s what really happens in the cockpit when pilots decide whether to land or “go around.”\n\n1. The Golden Rule: The Stabilised Approach\nEvery airline in the world (and every major regulator: FAA, EASA, ICAO) requires a “stabilised approach.”\n\nThat means by no later than 1,000 feet above the ground in good weather (or 500 feet in bad weather), the aircraft MUST meet every single one of these criteria:\n• Correct speed: not more than +10 knots or –5 knots from target\n• On the correct vertical path (the “glide slope” – the invisible 3-degree highway in the sky)\n• Only small heading changes needed (basically pointing at the runway)\n• Landing checklist and configuration complete: gear down, flaps set\n• Engines spooled up and stable (no big power changes needed)\n• Sink rate not excessive (normally less than 1,000 ft/min, much less near the ground)\n\nIf even one of those things is off — and it can’t be fixed instantly — the pilots are trained, and in many airlines required, to go around.\n\n2. Who Actually Makes the Decision?\nBoth pilots are monitoring. The pilot flying (PF) is hand-flying or watching the autopilot.\n\nThe pilot monitoring (PM) is calling out deviations: “Speed ten high… sinking eight hundred… slightly low on glide path…”\n\nAt many airlines the monitoring pilot literally says out loud at 1,000 ft: “Stabilised” or “Unstabilised – go around.”\n\nIf it’s unstabilised, the default answer is go around. Trying to “save” a bad approach is how almost all runway-overrun accidents start.\n\n3. Common Reasons for a Go-Around (none of them are emergencies)\n• Wind shear or sudden gusts that push the plane off the centreline or speed\n• The aircraft ahead is still on the runway and hasn’t cleared the “protected zone”\n• Unstable approach (too fast, too high, wrong flap setting, etc.)\n• Glideslope or localiser signal momentarily drops out in bad weather\n• Runway surface suddenly reported as contaminated (standing water, heavy braking action reports)\n• Deer or birds on the runway (yes, really)\n• ATC says “Go around” because of spacing or traffic conflict\n\nOnly about 1–3 flights in every 1,000 actually go around, but when they do, it’s celebrated in the industry. EasyJet, Ryanair, Delta, Emirates – they all have “Go-Around of the Month” awards. Seriously.\n\n4. What Happens When They Go Around\n• The pilot flying pushes the TOGA buttons (Take-Off/Go-Around) on the thrust levers\n• Full (or nearly full) power is applied automatically\n• The autopilot (if engaged) pitches the nose up to the perfect climb angle\n• Flaps are retracted one stage for better climb performance\n• Gear comes up\n• The plane follows a published “missed approach procedure” – a pre-programmed escape route that keeps you clear of mountains and other traffic\n\nYou feel exactly like a normal take-off, because that’s basically what it is: a take-off from 50–200 feet in the air.\n\n5. After the Go-Around\nYou’ll usually fly a quick circuit or a slightly longer loop, clean the aircraft up, and try again 5–15 minutes later when everything is perfect.\n\nIn worse weather you might hold for 20–30 minutes while the storm passes, or divert to your alternate airport (which was planned before you even left the gate).\n\n6. The Safety Statistics Are Insane\nModern go-around rates have helped make commercial flying ridiculously safe.\n\nIn the last 15 years there has been exactly ONE passenger fatality in a scheduled jet landing accident in the United States (Asiana 214 in 2013 – and that happened precisely because the crew ignored an unstable approach and did NOT go around).\n\nWorldwide, your chance of being in a fatal landing accident is roughly 1 in 20–30 million flights.\n\nSo when you feel that surge of power and the plane climbs away, smile.\n\nTwo highly trained pilots, backed by decades of engineering and strict procedures, just chose the safest possible option.\n\nA go-around isn’t a near-miss.\nIt’s the system working perfectly.\nYou’re not “almost in trouble.”\nYou’re in the safest place you could possibly be.</string>

    <string name="landing_a2">If you’re sitting by the window and can see the wing, you’ve probably noticed how much it moves. It bends upward in flight, then ripples and flexes the moment the wheels touch the runway. Those smooth, flowing motions are completely normal — and they’re one of the smartest safety features on the plane.\n\nHere’s why it happens and why it keeps you safer.\n\n1. Wings are built to flex — on purpose\nA Boeing 787’s wingtips can move upward more than 8 metres (26 feet) in flight.\nAn Airbus A350 can flex nearly 9 metres at the tips.\nEvery modern jet is designed this way, whether the wings are aluminium or carbon fibre.\n\nEngineers make the wings flexible so they can absorb huge forces instead of fighting them. A stiff wing would transfer every bump and gust straight to the cabin. A flexible wing soaks up the energy like a shock absorber.\n\n2. What’s happening at touchdown\nWhile you’re descending, the wings are bent upward because they’re producing lift. The moment the wheels touch:\n• Lift disappears in a split second.\n• All the aircraft’s weight shifts to the landing gear.\n• The wings gently spring back toward their natural shape.\n\nThat smooth “unloading” is what creates the graceful ripple you see. Any leftover energy makes the wing oscillate a couple of times — just like a diving board settling after someone jumps off.\n\n3. Windy landings make the movement even more noticeable\nIn gusty or crosswind conditions the wings are constantly adjusting right until touchdown. When the plane finally settles on the runway, all that stored energy is released at once, so the flexing looks more dramatic. The more the wing moves, the more energy it just absorbed for you.\n\n4. Real-world testing proves how strong they are\nBefore any new aircraft flies passengers, the wings are tested to extremes:\n• The plane is bolted to the ground.\n• Hydraulic rams bend the wings far beyond anything they’ll ever experience in service — usually 150% of the maximum load they’ll ever see.\n• The wings have to hold that position for several seconds and then return perfectly to shape.\n\nThe 787’s wings were flexed almost 8 metres upward in public testing — and sprang back as if nothing happened.\n\n5. Carbon-fibre wings (787, A350, 777X) take it even further\nNewer wings made of composite materials actually like to flex. They don’t develop tiny cracks over time the way metal can, and they stay smooth and strong for decades.\n\nThe calm bottom line\nThat gentle bending and rippling isn’t a sign of stress — it’s the wing doing its job exactly as designed. Every movement you see is energy that never reaches you.\n\nNext time you watch the wing flow and flex after landing, you can relax and think:\n“Everything is working perfectly. Those wings just turned a firm arrival into a smooth one.”\n\nYou’re witnessing brilliant engineering in action — and it’s keeping your ride as comfortable and safe as possible.</string>

    <string name="landing_q3">Braking Systems Explained: Reverse Thrust, Autobrake, and Anti-Skid</string>
    <string name="landing_a3">The moment the wheels touch down, a whole orchestra of braking systems kicks in automatically. You feel a gentle push forward in your seat, you hear a roar from the engines, and the plane slows down smoothly and predictably. Nothing is left to chance – everything is designed, tested, and triple-redundant.\n\nHere’s exactly what’s happening and why you can completely relax.\n\n1. Reverse Thrust – the loud roar that does most of the slowing at first\nAs soon as the main wheels touch the runway, big doors (or sleeves) on the engines flip forward.\nThe engines still produce the same power, but now most of the air is blown forward instead of backward.\nIt’s like opening a parachute behind a speeding car – you feel yourself pressed gently into the seat belt.\n\nModern engines are incredibly clever:\n• On Airbus aircraft, reverse thrust engages automatically the moment weight is on the wheels.\n• On Boeing, the pilot lifts the reverse levers, but the plane won’t let them deploy in the air – a safety lock prevents it.\n• Usually only about 50–70% reverse power is used on dry runways (to save brakes and engines). In rain or on short runways, they can use full reverse.\n\nYou’ll hear the roar fade away after 10–15 seconds because the plane is already slowing nicely.\n\n2. Autobrake – the invisible co-pilot who does the braking for you\nBefore landing, the pilots turn a knob to select one of five settings:\n• 1 or 2: gentle braking for long runways (you barely feel it)\n• 3: medium, most common on normal runways\n• MAX/AUTO MAX: very firm, used on short or slippery runways\n\nThe moment the wheels spin up (proving you’re really on the ground), the autobrake applies exactly the right pressure to slow the plane at a steady, pre-chosen rate.\nIt’s smoother and more consistent than even the best human pilot could manage, and it works together with anti-skid (see below).\nIf the pilots want to stop sooner, they simply press the brake pedals – autobrake instantly hands over control and disengages.\n\n3. Anti-Skid – the system that makes skidding almost impossible\nEvery main wheel has its own speed sensor. A computer watches all of them 20–40 times per second.\nIf one wheel starts slowing down much faster than the others (about to lock up on a wet or icy patch), the computer instantly releases that brake for a fraction of a second, then re-applies it – many times faster than a Formula 1 driver could.\n\nYou might feel a very slight pulsing or rumbling through the floor on a wet runway – that’s anti-skid doing its job perfectly. It guarantees the plane stops in a straight line and uses every bit of available grip.\n\n4. Extra layers of safety you never notice\n• Even if all wheel brakes failed completely, reverse thrust alone can stop most jets on a normal runway.\n• If reverse thrust failed, the wheel brakes and anti-skid can easily stop the plane.\n• If both failed (almost unheard of), the runway still has thousands of metres of overrun area, and many have engineered material (EMAS) – a special crushable concrete that stops a plane gently.\n\n5. Real numbers that calm the mind\nA Boeing 737 landing at 140 knots (260 km/h) on a dry runway with autobrake 3 stops in about 35–40 seconds and uses roughly 1,600–1,800 metres.\nOn a soaking wet runway it might need 2,200–2,400 metres – and every major airport runway is at least that long (most are 3,000–4,000 m).\nThe pilots already calculated the exact distance needed before takeoff, and the runway has huge safety margins built in.\n\nSo when you feel that gentle push forward, hear the engines roar, and watch the runway lights slow down outside your window – everything is working exactly as it should.\nThree independent, computer-controlled systems are sharing the job, watching each other, and making sure you stop smoothly and safely every single time.\n\nYou’re not relying on luck or a pilot stomping on the brakes.\nYou’re being slowed by some of the most reliable technology ever built.</string>

    <string name="landing_q4">Landing in Heavy Rain – How Pilots See the Runway</string>
    <string name="landing_a4">When you look outside and see torrential rain streaking across the window, it’s easy to wonder how the pilots can possibly see anything. The truth is: they don’t need to see nearly as much as you think, and everything is built to work perfectly even when the windshield looks like a car wash.\n\nHere’s exactly how it works.\n\n1. The runway is lit up like a Christmas tree\nModern runway edge lights, centreline lights, and approach lights are incredibly bright and designed to cut through heavy rain:\n• They are visible from 5–8 km (3–5 miles) away even in a downpour.\n• They are spaced every 30–60 metres and colour-coded (white → amber → red) so pilots instantly know how far they are from the end.\n• Touchdown zone lights and high-intensity strobes guide the last few seconds.\n\n2. Windshield wipers that actually work\nAirliner wipers are nothing like your car’s:\n• They sweep 2–3 times per second (faster than any road vehicle).\n• They are powered by hydraulic systems, not little electric motors.\n• Many aircraft have a hydrophobic rain-repellent coating (like Rain-X on steroids) that makes water bead and fly off instantly.\n• If it’s really torrential, the pilot can switch on a second layer of clear liquid repellent that spreads across the windshield.\n\n3. The invisible highway in the sky: ILS and beyond\nThe Instrument Landing System (ILS) is two radio beams:\n• One tells the plane if it’s left or right of the centreline (the “localiser”).\n• One tells it if it’s too high or too low (the “glideslope”).\n\nThese beams are accurate to within a few metres and work perfectly in any weather. On most flights, the autopilot follows them all the way down to 200 ft or lower. In really bad rain, the pilots can couple the autoland system and the plane flies itself to touchdown.\n\n4. Head-Up Display (HUD) – like a video game for pilots\nMany modern cockpits (especially Boeings) have a transparent screen right in the pilot’s line of sight:\n• A glowing green ladder and runway outline is projected onto the windshield.\n• Even if the real runway is barely visible through rain, the pilot sees a perfect virtual runway floating in front of them.\n• The HUD is so good that pilots can hand-fly a perfect approach in conditions where the windshield is almost opaque.\n\n5. Wet runway performance – calculated to the metre\nBefore every flight, the crew receives a detailed weather package. For rain they get:\n• Exact braking action reports from planes that landed minutes earlier (“braking action good/medium/poor”).\n• Precise water depth measurements if there’s standing water.\n\nThey plug those numbers into an iPad or EFB (Electronic Flight Bag). The software tells them the exact runway distance needed – with huge safety margins. If the numbers don’t add up, they divert long before they even start the approach. No guessing.\n\n6. Grooved runways and special tyres\nAlmost every major airport runway has thousands of tiny grooves cut into the surface (like the tread on a tyre). Water drains away instantly, so there’s almost never a sheet of water to hydroplane on.\nAircraft tyres have deep grooves and are inflated to 200+ psi – they squeeze water out sideways like a squeegee.\n\n7. The calm reality\nHydroplaning accidents on commercial jets are virtually unheard of in the last 30 years.\nIn the very rare event visibility drops below limits while on approach, the plane simply goes around automatically – exactly like in clear weather.\n\nSo when the rain is pouring down and the wipers are going like crazy, the pilots are relaxed.\nThey’re following bright lights and precise radio beams, the runway is draining perfectly, and multiple computers are double-checking everything.\n\nYou’re not landing “through” a storm.\nYou’re following a perfectly engineered path that works the same in sunshine or monsoon.</string>

    <string name="landing_q5">Crosswind Landings: Why the Plane Flies Sideways</string>
    <string name="landing_a5">When the wind is blowing across the runway instead of straight down it, the approach and touchdown can look dramatic from your window. The plane might fly in at an angle, the nose pointed off to one side, and at the last second it straightens up. It looks wild, but it’s one of the most practiced and safest maneuvers pilots do every day.\n\nHere’s exactly what’s happening and why it’s completely under control.\n\n1. Two techniques pilots use (often together)\n• The Crab: High up on final approach, the pilot points the nose into the wind. The plane is flying sideways through the air, but the track over the ground stays perfectly lined up with the runway. From your seat it looks like the plane is drifting sideways; it’s not. It’s moving straight down the runway centerline.\n\n• The Wing-Low (or sideslip): As the plane gets lower, the pilot lowers one wing into the wind and uses opposite rudder to keep the nose pointed straight down the runway. This is the smooth ballet move you sometimes see.\n\nMost landings use a bit of both: crab on the way down, then transition to wing-low in the last 100–200 feet.\n\n2. The “kick-out” or de-crab at the end\nJust before the wheels touch, the pilot straightens the nose with rudder and levels the wings (or almost levels them).\nThat quick rudder movement is what makes the plane suddenly line up with the runway. It feels like a gentle bump or sway, nothing more.\nThe whole thing happens in 1–2 seconds and is practiced hundreds of times in the simulator.\n\n3. The landing gear is built for sideways loads\nThe main wheels and gear legs are deliberately designed to handle big side loads.\nThey can touch down with the plane drifting slightly sideways and absorb it without stress. On some aircraft (especially Boeing), the gear even tilts slightly on touchdown to make it smoother.\n\n4. Real crosswind limits (what the plane can actually handle)\nTypical maximum demonstrated crosswind components for common jets:\n• Boeing 737: 35–38 knots\n• Airbus A320 family: 38 knots\n• Boeing 777: 40–44 knots\n• Boeing 787 &amp; Airbus A350: 40–44 knots\n\nAirlines usually set their own limit 5–10 knots lower than that for extra comfort and safety.\nA 25–30 knot crosswind feels noticeable to passengers but is routine for crews; they land in it several times a week.\n\n5. How pilots train for it\nEvery six months pilots spend hours in the simulator practicing crosswind landings in 40-knot gusting winds, low visibility, wet runways, and even engine failures combined with crosswinds.\nThey have to prove they can land safely in the worst conditions the airline allows before they’re allowed to fly passengers.\n\n6. The calm truth\nThat sideways approach and last-second straightening isn’t the pilot “fighting” the wind.\nIt’s a deliberate, carefully taught technique that has been perfected over decades.\nThe plane is designed for it, the gear is designed for it, and the pilots have practiced it hundreds of times.\nWhat looks dramatic from row 23 is completely standard from the cockpit.\n\nNext time you see the plane flying in at an angle, you can relax and think:\n“Perfectly normal. They do this all the time, and they’re really good at it.”</string>

    <string name="landing_q6">Fog and Low-Visibility Landings: How the Plane Lands When the Runway Is Invisible</string>
    <string name="landing_a6">When fog, heavy rain, or darkness swallows the runway, the aircraft switches to its most precise and safest mode: autoland. The plane follows two invisible radio beams broadcast from the runway (one for left/right guidance, one for height) that are accurate down to a few centimetres. These beams work perfectly no matter how thick the fog is.\n\nLong before you reach the airport, the crew checks the reported visibility. Most big airports today are equipped for Category III approaches, which means the plane can land with almost zero forward visibility (sometimes as little as 50 metres, sometimes none at all).\n\nHere’s what happens:\n\n1. Two or three independent autopilots are engaged at the same time. They constantly cross-check each other; if they disagree by even a tiny amount, the system instantly disconnects and the plane climbs away automatically for another try.\n\n2. The autopilots fly the entire approach, flare, and touchdown. The flare (that gentle nose-up movement just before the wheels touch) happens at about 50 feet, and the landing is usually smoother than on a clear day because the computers react faster and more precisely than any human can.\n\n3. After the wheels touch, the autobrakes and automatic rudder keep the plane exactly on the centreline until it’s slow enough for the pilots to take over and taxi (many airports now have “follow-the-greens” taxiway lights that guide them through the fog).\n\nEverything is triple-redundant: radios, computers, hydraulics, electrical power. The system is designed so that even if one part fails, the landing continues safely.\n\nPilots train for this every six months in the simulator, and the technology has been in daily use for over fifty years with an impeccable safety record.\n\nSo when the world outside your window turns completely grey or white, nothing is wrong. The aircraft is now being flown with more precision, more redundancy, and less human input than on a bright sunny day.\n\nThe plane doesn’t need to see the runway.\nIt knows exactly where it is, and it’s taking you down perfectly.</string>

    <string name="landing_q7">Landing on Wet or Contaminated Runways: Why the Plane Still Stops</string>
    <string name="landing_a7">Rain, standing water, slush, or even a light dusting of snow doesn’t turn a runway into an ice rink. Everything is measured, calculated, and backed by huge safety margins long before the wheels touch down.\n\nHere’s how it really works.\n\n1. Every time a plane lands ahead of you, the pilots send a short report: “braking action good”, “medium”, or “poor”. Those reports go instantly to every crew waiting to land, including yours.\n\n2. Your pilots take those numbers (plus temperature, wind, and exact water/snow depth if reported) and enter them into an iPad or onboard laptop. In seconds the software tells them exactly how much runway they will need to stop, always with at least a 15–67 % extra safety margin required by law (67 % extra if the braking report is “poor”).\n\nExample: a Boeing 737 on a perfectly dry 3,000-metre runway normally stops in about 1,500–1,800 metres. On a soaking wet runway with “medium” braking it might need 2,400 metres. Every major airport runway is at least 2,500–4,000 metres long, so there is still plenty left over.\n\nIf the numbers are even slightly too close, the pilots simply divert to another airport. They make that decision while still 200–300 miles out, not at the last second.\n\n3. The runway itself helps enormously. Almost all big airports have grooved or porous surfaces that drain water away instantly. A heavy rainstorm can dump buckets, yet within seconds the surface is almost dry again.\n\n4. The tyres are high-pressure (200+ psi) and have deep grooves that squeeze water sideways like a squeegee. Combined with anti-skid brakes that pulse 20–40 times per second, hydroplaning is practically impossible at normal landing speeds.\n\n5. In winter, runways are treated with de-icing liquids and swept constantly. If there’s more than a thin layer of slush or snow, the airport closes the runway until it’s cleared. Airlines won’t land until it’s officially safe.\n\nEven in the extremely rare worst-case where every brake failed (which has never happened on a modern jet), reverse thrust alone can stop the plane, and beyond the end of the runway there are usually 300–1,000 metres of clear safety area, plus crushable concrete beds (EMAS) at many airports that stop a plane gently if it ever overruns.\n\nSo when the runway outside looks shiny and wet, nothing is being left to chance.\nThe distance has already been calculated to the metre, the surface is engineered to drain instantly, and multiple independent braking systems are ready.\n\nThe plane will slow down and stop exactly where it always does, smoothly and predictably.</string>

    <string name="landing_q8">Thunderstorm Avoidance: Why Pilots Never Land in an Active Storm</string>
    <string name="landing_a8">Thunderstorms look dramatic from the ground, but from the cockpit they are treated with absolute respect. No commercial pilot will ever try to land in or near an active storm cell. Here’s why, and how easily it’s avoided.\n\n1. Pilots can see thunderstorms long before you can\nEvery airliner has a weather radar that paints storms in bright red and magenta up to 320 nautical miles (600 km) ahead. A single active cell stands out like a neon sign. Dispatchers on the ground also send updated radar pictures every few minutes.\n\n2. The unbreakable rule: stay at least 20 nautical miles away\nRegulations and airline policy require crews to stay 20 miles (37 km) sideways from any active thunderstorm (more if it’s particularly intense). Above the storm, the distance increases to 5,000–10,000 ft vertically.\nThat distance is so large that lightning, hail, and severe turbulence almost never reach the aircraft.\n\n3. Microbursts and wind shear are the real danger, and they’re detected instantly\nModern aircraft have predictive wind-shear systems that look 3–5 miles ahead. If the air suddenly changes direction or speed (a microburst), the cockpit speakers shout “WINDSHEAR! WINDSHEAR!” and the plane automatically applies full power and climbs.\nThese systems have prevented every single microburst accident since they became standard in the 1990s.\n\n4. If a storm is sitting over the airport\n• Flights hold in large racetrack patterns 50–100 miles away until the cell moves off (usually 20–40 minutes).\n• Or they divert to a planned alternate airport that was chosen before takeoff, with enough extra fuel for exactly this situation.\n• ATC clears entire corridors so no one has to fly near the storm.\n\n5. Lightning is loud but harmless\nAircraft are hit by lightning once or twice a year on average. The aluminium or carbon-fibre skin acts like a Faraday cage; the charge travels around the outside and exits through static wicks on the trailing edges. Passengers and systems inside are completely protected. The pre-flight walk-around checks for tiny entry/exit marks, and that’s it.\n\nThe calm reality\nYou will never see a pilot attempt to “thread the needle” between storm cells to land. If the radar shows red anywhere near the final approach path, the crew simply goes somewhere else.\n\nHolding a little longer or landing at the next suitable airport is so routine that crews treat it like a minor schedule change, not a drama.\n\nSo when you hear the captain say “we’re just going to hold for a few minutes while a storm cell clears the area” or “we’ll be diverting to our alternate,” smile.\nIt means the system is working exactly as it should, keeping you far away from the one type of weather aviation always treats with zero tolerance.</string>

    <string name="landing_q9">Can We Hit a Building or Mountain When Flying in Clouds or Fog?</string>
    <string name="landing_a9">Short answer: No. Not even close.\n\nHere’s why it’s actually impossible on a commercial flight.\n\n1. The plane always knows exactly where it is\nModern airliners use triple GPS + inertial navigation systems that are accurate to within a few metres, even if every satellite disappeared.\nThese systems never drift more than a couple of hundred metres even after flying across the Atlantic with zero outside references.\n\n2. The ground is mapped in 3D\nEvery aircraft carries an Enhanced Ground-Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) with a worldwide terrain and obstacle database.\nIt knows the height and exact location of every mountain, radio tower, and tall building on Earth.\nIf the plane ever gets within about 30 seconds of hitting anything, the cockpit blares “TERRAIN! TERRAIN! PULL UP!” and a big red warning flashes. The system has saved hundreds of flights.\n\n3. Air traffic control has multiple safety nets\n• Controllers see your exact position and altitude on radar.\n• Their Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) system automatically alerts them if you descend below a safe height for your location.\n• In busy areas, TCAS (the anti-collision system) will tell you to climb or descend if you ever get near high ground, even if everyone else somehow missed it.\n\n4. Departure and arrival paths are drawn far above obstacles\nEvery published route and approach is designed to keep you at least 1,000 ft (often 2,000–5,000 ft) above the highest obstacle or terrain within 10–25 miles.\nIn mountainous areas the minimum altitudes are much higher (sometimes 10,000–15,000 ft above the peaks).\n\n5. In clouds or fog the plane is usually on autopilot following a pre-programmed path\nThat path was designed years ago by engineers who triple-checked it against every hill and building.\nThe autopilot flies it with far more precision than any human could.\n\n6. Real-life proof\nSince EGPWS became mandatory in the early 2000s, there has not been a single passenger jet accident worldwide caused by flying into terrain in clouds or fog on a properly flown approach or departure.\n\nSo when the clouds are thick and you can’t see anything outside, the plane is actually being guided by some of the most accurate and redundant navigation systems ever built.\nMountains and buildings are mapped, monitored, and avoided by multiple independent layers of technology and procedure.\n\nYou’re surrounded by invisible walls of safety that make it impossible to get anywhere near the ground unless something catastrophic and extraordinarily improbable happens to every system at once.\nIn clouds or fog, you’re often safer than on a clear day, because the automation and safeguards are doing all the work perfectly.\n\nFeel free to relax and enjoy the quiet grey view. Nothing out there can reach you.</string>
